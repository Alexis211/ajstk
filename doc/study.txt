Description of the study mechanisms for AJSTK
2011, Alex AUVOLAT


All of this is handled mostly by a Go package called 'study'.

USER ATTRIBUTES
===============

For each user's database file, a table called 'attributes' keeps track of the settings the
user asked for. This includes :
- password, email
- currently visiting level and lesson
- enabled and disabled SRS subgroups (see below)


TRACK STUDY PROGRESS
====================

A first sql table called 'chunk_study', for each user, keeps track of the status of a
user's studying a lesson.
Fields are the following :
- level, lesson, chunk name (indexes the table)
- status = one of :
  - reading : the user is studying the lesson
  - repeat : the user has added the items to the SRS system
  - done : the user masters the chunk's contents and is quite sure he won't forget it

From this data, the lessons can have several status for the user :
- Not available for study
- Available for study (all required lessons have been studied and are considered 'done')
- Studying : all chunks have an entry in 'chunk_study', and some are still at 'reading'
- Done : all chunks have an entry in 'chunk_study', and all have the 'repeat' or 'done'
  status.

The lesson and chunk statuses are kept in a cache in memory in the server.

The user has to ask for available lessons to go to studying status.
The user has to ask for 'reading' chunks to go to 'repeat' status, and for 'repeat' chunks
to go to 'done' status.
The user is also notified when all the SRS items are known, with a repeat-done status, so
that he can easily mark them as 'done' if he wishes to.
From the 'done' status, the user can go back to 'repeat' if he wishes to start studying
again. From 'repeat', he can go to 'done' whenever he wants, even if the items aren't all
marked as known in the SRS.


TRACK MEMORIZATION PROGRESS
===========================

Classification
--------------

This is done using a SRS system. The SRS system classifies elements in groups and
subgroups : groups are one of 'kana', 'kanji', 'vocabulary', 'sentences', and subgroups
correspond to study levels.
Review is never done for all the content, always for a given group or a given subgroup of
a given group. Each subgroups of a group can be activated or deactivated for the
group-global review process.

Learning
--------

Before adding the chunk's SRS items to the SRS study process, the user can use a 'drill'
mode that will help him memorize these items for the first time. The questions are the same
than for the review mode (see below), and all the cards stay in the looping deck until the
user has gotten all of them right. The drill mode is available for the items in a chunk,
but since there may be only a few, it is also available for all the items in the whole
lesson.

Reviewing
---------

The cards are keepen in boxes, and have a next review date.
When a card is added, it goes to box 0 and the next review date is set to tomorrow.
When reviewing a card, if the two questions are answered correctly, the card goes to
the next box, and the next review date is set to today + interval for that box (see table).
If one or both questions fail, the card goes to box 0, and the next review date is set to
tomorrow.
The box number for an item determines whether the item is well known or not.

Box ID		0		1		2		3		4		5+
Interval	NA		1 day	2 days	4 days	7 days	11,18,30,50,+inf days
Colour		black	red		orange	yellow	yellow	green (known)

The user can also have a quick access to a list of the items he failed or started learning
today and will be reviewing tomorrow. From there he can do a drill on these cards.

Items have the 'known' status once they are in box 5 or upper.

Questions
---------

SRS items (cards) have four basic information on them :
- meaning (english, french, ...)
- japanese with kanji
- japanese reading (only when necessary)
- comment from the lesson (optionnal)
When a user reviews a card, two questions are asked :
- the user is given the meaning and must tell the kanji and reading fields
- the user is given the kanji and must tell the meaning and reading fields
The two questions are asked at different moments of the review process, and the user must
have the two right for the review to be considered successfull. When the question is asked,
the system also tells the group and subgroup the card belongs to. The user has two
textareas to prepare his answers, but these are not taken into account automatically : the
evaluation is done solely by the user pressing "yes" or "no" once the answer is shown.

SQL table
---------

The SQL table 'srs_study' contains all the elements that the user has added to his study
process. The elements are added when a chunk gets the 'repeat' status, and removed when the
chunk gets the 'done' status.
Fields are the following :
- level, lesson, chunk from which the item comes from (indexes the table)
- group and subgoup (indexes the table)
- meaning, kanji, reading, comment
- box ID, next review date (indexes the table)
- a note to self for the user on that card

THE STUDY.USER INTERFACE
========================

Here are the functions available to the study.User object :
- GetLessonStatuses(level)
- GetChunkStatuses(level, lesson)
- GetSRSItemStatuses(level, lesson, chunk)
- StartStudyingLesson(level, lesson)
- SetChunkStatus(level, lesson, chunk, status[reading,repeat,done])
- ... more (srs)
